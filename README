Setup Procedure
===============
If you want to install the code with your dataset (so that you can directly test the codes with your copy of the TED dataset),
you need to take the following steps: 
1) Modify the tedanalytics/TED_data_location.py file to put the dataset path (get the dataset from the following location:
dropbox. Use patial sync to include only the relevant folders. The total dataset is very large) 
2) Run ted_talk_makeindex.py file. This should go smoothly 
3) Run ted_talk_data_feeder.py. This should go smoothly 
4) Run ted_talk_statistic.py and ted_talk_statistic_correlation.py for checking the dataset statistics. This should match with the paper
